# UART-Protocol-Implementation
This repository contains the Verilog source code for a simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter). The design is a standard 8-N-1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) transceiver capable of serial communication. The project includes a synthesizable RTL design and a self-checking testbench for verification.
